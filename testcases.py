"""
Test cases for Nimble semantic analysis. See also the `testhelpers`
module.

Test harnesses have been provided for testing correct semantic
analysis of valid and invalid expressions.

**You will need to provide your own testing mechanisms for varDecs,
statements and higher-level constructs as appropriate.**

Notes:

    1 - So in the testing for variable declarations (and also in the variable tests),
    one possible case of error involves a mistype of the variable-field in the test case. For example,

    (script = 'var myBool : Bool = 100', variable = 'wrongVar', error_category = Category.ASSIGN_TO_WRONG_TYPE)

    would try to find the type of the variable under name 'wrongVar'. But since the script never declared a variable
    of such name, then it would obviously result in wrongVar being undefined.

    In terms of variable declaration, indeed this is an error, yet it only is only one that arises in a mistake
    in writing the unit test.

    Same principal applies in the Variable tests - typing in a mismatching variable name in the variable field that
    does not correspond to any variable declared in the script would result in KeyError when it tries to find the
    passed in variables type in the index_types dictionary (of course, it wouldn't exist). However, this would
    only be a mistake that could occur in the design of the test cases.

    It was deemed worthy to discern the differences between a mistake in the test case design, and an intentionally
    invalid test case which was meant to fail. Consequently, for both valid and invalid tests of this nature (with
    a script), there would be a check to see if the passed in variable type was correct - indeed, it would be point-
    less to carry out any sort of test if the test case itself was not constructed correctly to enable proper testing.
